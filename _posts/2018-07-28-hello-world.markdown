### My notes from Joe Rogan podcast with  Naval Wisdom
 These are not my thoughts, rather my collections of
 notes for future reference:

Top 3 things everyone wants or should be wanting. 

* Wealth. 
* Happiness.
* Health.

Lets talk about wealth, shall we ?

We will not become rich by renting our time. We rent our time to our employer, and in return get a monthly salary.
The employer, dictates how, what and where should we work. 

We don't earn when we are on vacation and while we sleep.

Sure hard work is important, but one does not simply can become wealthy by working hard, we have to work on the right thing with the right people.  

One can become rich by :
- Owning a piece of business.
- Having an equity as an owner or an investor.
- Becoming a share holder of a brand.

 
Industrial model of organizations are going to change: Boss's, hierarchy and processes (which slows you down)

We can see these days, with the advent of remote work and #digital nomads


More and more people like to own their schedule, own their time and place and time where they are most productive. In short people are favouring *time and location independence*.
 
Everyone can be rich!
 lack of material possessions can make you un-happy but getting rich can not make you happy.

 lot of people struggle whole life to make money nad
then they make some and when they are exhausted and think wait why i am not happy...if you are smart you should be happy


How someone can solve their money problem : 

1) Lowering your lifestyle.
2) Making enough money. 
3) Retirment is when you stop sacrificing today for some 
imagenapry tomorrow.

1) Lot of money saved up and the passive income from that..
covers your burn rate, keep your burn ratre low.
 
 2) drive your burn rate to zero ...become a monk (Don't do that if you are reading this)
 
 3) Do something you love, you love so much it's not about money anymore for you. 

 1) Have specfic knoweledeg and skillset is the have skilset, you don't have competion...becuase you are authentic, 
 find the thing you know to do better than anybody becuase you love to do  ...
 * authentic
 * map that what society wants
 * levarage,
 * Put your name on it, take the risk but you gain the rewards.

 Ignore the peer, upgrading liefestyle, buying unwanted thingsm, 
 
 Changing the defination of peers.
 Do a remote job, live on low cost country neghnbhoor hood
 save money.

----------

## Happiness:

If fitness can be choice, health can be choice,
nutrition can be a choice, working hard and making money can be a choice than _happiness can also be a choice_.


What is a Desire, a contract to make yourself un-happy and or suffer, until you get what you want.

Question to ask every time you are un-happy ? 
What is the underline desire I am looking to fulfil ?

Don't have too many desires and pick them unconsciously, or have thousands of them. For example my coffee is too dark, it's too hot here, there is a cat litter in my garden.

Pick one overwhelming desire and suffer on that and let other let go. Save your energy for one desire.

| We live in the age of ultimate leverage, your action can be multiplied by 1000 fold by
- broadcasting to podcast,
- investing capital or  
- having people who are working for you or
- by writing code


So the impact of good decision making is much higher than it's used to be. And an happy, calm and a peaceful person will make better decisions and have better outcomes.

In order to stay peaceful and happy block them
Any Outrage or stupidity...on social media or in real life. -
- snippets taken out of context, shared on news and in soical media 
the mind is cluttered with junk -- what you pay attention.

Twitter/FB/Instagram if you get addicted yor brain will be cluttered

Ancient Struggle : against other tribes 
Modern struggle :  Free, parents and friends don't live nearby , no tribal meaning , no relegion  - > when they come to attact you -- SM, sugar, porn , you stand alone
diseases of abduncance -> over exposed to evertthing...so *the way to survice in the
modern socity is to be ascetic, retreat from soiciety, ....turn it offf...meditation*


Mediatation :
- It works
- monkey mind is  a disease, 
- learn to rest your mind.
- really its an hard art of doing nothing
- when grow up, emails are piling up ---
- regrets, issues, problem, comes up
- self therapy...lsistening to yourslef
- magic of inbox zero.
- process everthing one day
- I will not use an app.
- sit down - close eyes- let the thought pass, don't judge ..whatever happens happens
- Peace...happiness at rest---
convert Peace to happpintes ==> anytime --if your Peaceful you do happy activities.


- Pease from inside to give up this idea of solving all the problems.
- Do the things or live the life you want other people to live (strange way to go about it)
they won't give up econmoic growth.

> Specialization for insects

> you have got one life, do many different things

Why its hard to start something different? 
Because when you have a niche, you have to start over.
Mostly people have no time because of other commitments and it's painful 
but may be best thing to do.start over the ability to start over is rare one ex Elon Musk. 
You should be willing to be fool, and try new things, If you are not 
doing this you are just getting older.



...aha moments, when you connect two things, the knowledge you had
and by fulfilling the curosity 

## _Reading_
* read not to finish. The number of books you read, is a vanity metric.
Pile of books, is a show off....read one books over and over again...until you 
fully observe them, would be a better option if you would like. 
Flip the book , looking for ideas, don't burdern to necessarily finish it.

But if you find something interesting, reflect on it research and get deeper understanding.


*Modern society struggles* 

Two way to look into the abundance of information.
1) there is so many infomation to consume and it creates confusion and leades to imposter syndrom
2) Look at a way that there are so much info in different social media platforms, If 
I want to go deep into anything I can do it, at any given time.


Social media - signalling our image that is build by compliments.
viewing ourslef as how we want others to see us.
```




You want to be calmest, coolest cucumbe in the room who can figure out the correct answer
you want be wealthy and stay sane.


## Random thoughts and Quotes
 > work like lion, hunt....sprints...reset / re-access / feedback / sprint again.

> machines should be working to 9-5 

finite earth resources -- no growth. billions of chines/indian are not going to stay in poverty - they want cleaner water anf get gealthier....

way out tech--green technology...

- how to green tech...


Learn from self as I am forces to articulate it, I can think all day....there are gaps and leaps in my thinking, speaking or writing forces you to articulate and 

when I force to write it down or speak to someone --- than you are forced to fill gaps and articlate and lesrn from the own thoughts.

Biggest mistake is `memoriztions` ...you have  to deep understanding of what you do and why you do it and know the basic really well. Memorization is a indication you don't understand it.


ex knowing basic atrhimetic is must and more important than advance calculus and algebra.
 
What could be the answer of life ? not what is ? 

the problem is why Question , why again ...

Gripple trilima 

1)  infinte regres. why is why 
2)  circlar reason a b c a b a
3)  axiam ..god, big 

if there was a single answer, then we will complete with each other, do whatever you 
want.


answer are paradox, pointless to pursue, but the act of pusing is usefull.


How to resist these things by drawing your own boundaries and there is no to hlep you

If your belifes are same as your neighbhours and friends you are not a clear thinker
the belives are socialized they are taken from society 
if you want to become clear thinker, do not pay attention to politics,
it will destory your ability to think.



Lets get them all rich, fit and healthy and than happy.





 IT is NOT EASY. IT IS THE FREAKING HARDS THING TO DO 
  but also the most rewarding one you would do.


  Have to do hard things in life, to make meaning of your life, 
  making money is fine one.

  The more you judge (annoy by little things) the more you separate from others, see negative things  ..
  
  The world reflects your own feeling back at you 
  Reality is neutral (no jugement, not rigth or wrong)


  Happiness is a choice if you belive its choice you can start working on it.


> Every man has 2 life , and second start when he realise he has one.


Happy thoughts disappear and negative linger...but if you think  more postive ..


smile more..
hug more....
sunlight..
nature...
watch your mind all day long, not control not judge ...its mediate 24 / 7

Watch your own thoughts, why i am having that thought does that serve me 
anymnore.....
when you understand why you have the thought you caml down.

Pick an hourly rate...if you are doing anything you don't want to do it...
outsource..exclude family leisure etc...
