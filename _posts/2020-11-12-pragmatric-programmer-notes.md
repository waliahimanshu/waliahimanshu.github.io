# Pragmatic Programmer - Notes

### Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

Who are Pragmatic programers
Has attitude, a style,a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions.
They think beyond the immediate problem, place it in  larger context and seeking out the bigger picture. 
They make intelligent compromises and informed decisions and most importantly take responsibility of everything they do.

### 1 . You have agency
Software development appear close to the top of any list of careers where
you have control. Our skills are in demand, our knowledge crosses geographic
boundaries, we can work remotely. Trick is to ask for anything you want from organization and always remember "you can change your organization or change your organization."
You’re investing in yourself, so doing it while you’re off-the-clock is only reasonable.

### 2. The Cat Ate My Source Code
Team trust - your team needs to be able to trust and rely on you, in a healty team environment you can speak up your mind.
Responsibility - when you accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make a mistake (as we all do ) try to offer solutions then blame.
**Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses**
Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can’t be done, is
late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How’s it going to sound to your boss?
Run through the *conversation in your mind*. What is the other person likely
to say? Sometimes, you just know what they are going to
say, so save them the trouble.

### 3. Software Entropy - means amount of disorder in any system. Software rot or tech debt.

*A broken window Analogy* 
One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills
in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—So another window gets broken.
People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In
a relatively short span of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the
owner’s desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality.

*Don’t Live with Broken Windows*
Don’t leave “broken windows’’ (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code)
unrepaired.  Comment, fix the broken window or comment to suggest the improvements and come back to it. But don't leave broken windows.

*A fire fighter analagy* : 
The house was immaculate, loaded with priceless antiques
The fire department rushed in to save burning house one day. But before they
dragged their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire
raging—to roll out a mat between the front door and the source of the fire.
They didn’t want to mess up the carpet.
Now that sounds pretty extreme. Surely the fire department’s first priority is
to put out the fire. But they clearly had assessed
the situation, were confident of their ability to manage the fire, and were
careful not to inflict unnecessary damage to the property. That’s the way it
must be with software: don’t cause collateral damage just because there’s a
crisis of some sort.

If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it’s all too easy to slip into the mindset of “All the rest of this code is crap. By the same token, if you find yourself on a project where the code is
pristinely beautiful—cleanly written, well designed, and elegant—you will
likely take extra special care not to mess it up, just like the firefighters. Even if there’s a fire raging (deadline, release date, trade show demo, etc.),you don’t want to be the first one to make a mess and inflict additional damage.

### 4. Stone soup and boiled frog
*Be a Catalyst for Change*

You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how
to do it. The entire system just appears before your eyes—you know it’s right.
But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you’ll be met with delays
and blank stares. People will form committees, budgets will need approval,
and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own resources.
Sometimes this is called “start-up fatigue.’
It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for.
Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then
say “of course, it would be better if we added…’’ Pretend it’s not important.
Sit back and wait for them to start asking you to add the functionality you
originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing success.

### 5. Good-Enough Software
Bug-free software is a myth.
Time, technology, and temperament all conspire against us.
Make good enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind. You’ll find that you are more productive and your users are happier.
Involve Your Users in the Trade-Off

Make Quality a Requirements Issue - As a user,
would you rather (1) wait for them to get all the bugs out, (2) have complex
software and accept some bugs, or (3) opt for simpler software with fewer
defects?


### 6. Your Knowledge Portfolio
- Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio

The early bird might get the worm, but what happens to the early worm?
Your knowledge and
experience are your most important day-to-day professional assets.
Unfortunately, they’re expiring assets.7 Your knowledge becomes out of date
as new techniques, languages, and environments are developed

1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.
2. Diversification is the key to long-term success. (different domains, disciplines )
3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and highrisk,
high-reward investments. (new languages framework )
4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.

** This can be learned. The trick is to make yourself do it initially and
form a habit. Develop a routine which you follow until your brain internalizes
it. At that point, you’ll find yourself sucking up new knowledge automatically **

When learning Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
trick: ask “why?” at least five times. Ask a question,
and get an answer. Dig deeper by asking “why?”


### 7. Communicate!

Having the best ideas, the finest code, or the most
pragmatic thinking is ultimately sterile unless you can communicate with
other people. A good idea is an orphan without effective communication
**A large part of our day is spent communicating, so we need to do it well**

Continuously improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate.Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, “Does this
communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works.

Make your style of communication and for make it look good (Your company may already have defined style sheets that you can use.).
Communicate well and listen well, when you don't know Get back to people.

When writing that Pull request description or a slack message or email.
Proofread, check for spelling mistakes. omit un-necessary words. Make is clear and short. User code snippets to explain where necessary
