### Notes from Joe Rogan podcast with Naval

### Happiness:
If fitness can be choice, health can be choice, nutrition can be a choice, working hard and making money can be a choice than _happiness can also be a choice_.

>*What is a desire* ?
A contract to make yourself un-happy and suffer, until you get what you want.

Question to ask every time you are un-happy ? 
What is the underline desire, I am looking to fulfil.

Don't have too many desires and pick them unconsciously, or have thousands of them. For example, my coffee is too dark, it's too hot here, there is a cat litter in my garden, small things will eat up your energy.
Pick one overwhelming desire and suffer on that and let other let go. Save your energy for that one desire.

We live in the age of ultimate leverage, your action can be multiplied by thousand fold by:
- Broadcasting to podcast
- Investing capital 
- People working for you 
- By writing code

So the impact of good decision making is much higher than it's used to be. And happy, calm and a peaceful person will make better decisions with better outcomes.

In order to stay peaceful and happy, block:
1. any outrage, stupidity on social media and in your surrounding. 
2. snippets taken out of context, modified shared on news and in social media. If paid attention, they will clutter the mind.
3. The world reflects your own feeling back at you. The more you judge (annoy by little things) the more you separate from others, see negative things.
4. Watch your own thoughts, why i am having that thought does this serve me anymore, often when you understand why you have that thought, you feel calmer.

*Ancient Struggle*, were against other tribes, religion and food.
*Modern society struggles*, is with yourself. 

Parents, friends don't live nearby, no tribal meaning, no religion connection.
When they come to attack you : social media algorithms, video games, sugar, porn you stand alone
These all are diseases of abundance, over exposure to everything, so *the way to survive is to be ascetic, retreat from society beliefs. _Turn it off_

Meditation :
- It is an art of doing nothing.
- Monkey mind is a disease, learn to rest your mind.
- Regrets, issues, problem, gets pilled up over time, therefore its necessary to sit down and close your eyes. Let your thoughts pass, don't judge, don't react and analyse.

> Peace is happiness at rest

## What is the meaning of life? 

If there was a single answer, then we will compete with each other.
Answers are paradox, pointless to pursue, but the act of pursing is useful.

Do hard things in life, to make meaning of your life, and 
making money is fine one.
*IT is NOT EASY. IT IS THE FREAKING HARDS THING YOU WILL  DO *
_but also the most rewarding one._

Just :

- Smile more.
- Hug more.
- Go out in nature and in Sunlight.
- Happy thoughts disappear and negative linger, but you can trick your mind by looking positive aspects in every scenario.
