### Happiness:
If fitness can be choice, health can be choice, nutrition can be a choice, working hard and making money can be a choice than _happiness can also be a choice_.

>*What is a desire* ?
A contract to make yourself un-happy and or suffer, until you get what you want.

Question to ask every time you are un-happy ? 
What is the underline desire, I am looking to fulfil.

Don't have too many desires and pick them unconsciously, or have thousands of them. For example my coffee is too dark, it's too hot here, there is a cat litter in my garden, small things will eat up your energy.
Pick one overwhelming desire and suffer on that and let other let go. Save your energy for one desire.

We live in the age of ultimate leverage, your action can be multiplied by 1000 fold by
- Broadcasting to podcast
- Investing capital 
- People working for you 
- By writing code

So the impact of good decision making is much higher than it's used to be. And an happy, calm and a peaceful person will make better decisions and have better outcomes.

In order to stay peaceful and happy block:
- any outrage, stupidity on social media or in real life. 
- snippets taken out of context, modified shared on news and in social media.
If paid attention, this will clutter the mind.
The more you judge (annoy by little things) the more you separate from others, see negative things.
  
>The world reflects your own feeling back at you 

Ancient Struggle :  were against other tribes, religion and food.

*Modern society struggles* 

Modern struggle :   Parents and friends don't live nearby , no tribal meaning , no religion  - > when they come to attack you -- social media algorithms, sugar, porn , you stand alone
diseases of abundance -> over exposed to everything...so *the way to survive iis to be ascetic, retreat from society. _Turn it off_

Meditation :
- It is an art of doing nothing.
- Monkey mind is a disease, learn to rest your mind.

Regrets, issues, problem, gets pilled up over time, therefore its necessary to sit down and close your eyes .Let the thoughts pass, don't judge, don't react and analyse.
Watch your own thoughts, why i am having that thought does this serve me 
anymore , often when you understand why you have that thought,  you feel calmer.

Biggest mistake is `memorization's` . you have  to deep understanding of what you do and why you do it and know the basic really well. Memorization is a indication you don't understand it.


##What could be the answer of life ? not what is ? 

[Agrippan trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma)

1)  Regressive argument,  why ?  why?   
2)  Circular argument, 
3)  Axiomatic argument ..god, big 

if there was a single answer, then we will compete with each other.
Answers are paradox, pointless to pursue, but the act of pursing is useful.


Why its hard to start something different? 
Because when you have a niche, you have to start over.
Mostly people have no time because of other commitments and it's painful 
but may be best thing to do.start over the ability to start over is rare one ex Elon Musk. 
You should be willing to be fool, and try new things, If you are not 
doing this you are just getting older.


Have to do hard things in life, to make meaning of your life, and 
making money is fine one.
*IT is NOT EASY. IT IS THE FREAKING HARDS THING YOU WILL  DO *
_but also the most rewarding one._
