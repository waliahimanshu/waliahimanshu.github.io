# Team topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow
# by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton - Notes

### Chapter 1 - The problem with org charts

Modern IT organizations must deliver and operate
software systems rapidly and safely, while simultaneously growing and adapting to changes and pressures in the business or regulatory environment

#### Communication Structures of an Organization

It usually shows
hierarchical lines of reporting, which imply lines of communication running “up and
down” the organization.

But people don’t restrict their communications only to those connected
lines on the chart. We reach out to whomever we depend on to get work done. We bend
the rules when required to achieve our goals. That’s why actual communication lines look
quite different from the org chart

#### Org Chart Thinking Is the Problem

decisions based on org-chart structure tend to optimize for only part of
the organization, ignoring upstream and downstream effects. Local optimizations help
the teams directly involved, but they don’t necessarily help improve the overall delivery
of value to customers. Their impact might be negligent if there are larger bottlenecks in
the stream of work. For example, having teams adopting cloud and infrastructure-as-code
can reduce the time to provision new infrastructure from weeks or months to minutes or
hours. But if every change requires deployment (to production) approval from a board
that meets once a week, then delivery speed will remain weekly at best.

Thinking of the org chart as a faithful representation of how work gets done and how
teams interact with each other leads to ineffective decisions around allocation of work
and responsibilities. Much like a software architecture document gets outdated as soon as
the actual software development starts, an org chart is always out of sync with reality.


So if org charts are not an accurate representation of organizational structures, what is?
Niels Pflaeging, author of Organize for Complexity, identifies not one but three different

organizational structures in every organization:?

1. Formal structure (the org chart)—facilitates compliance

2. Informal structure—the “realm of influence” between individuals

3. Value creation structure—how work actually gets done based on inter-personal and
inter-team reputation

#### Team Topologies: A New Way of Thinking about Teams
eam Topologies provides four fundamental team types—stream-aligned, platform,
enabling, and complicated-subsystem—and three core team interaction modes
—collaboration, X-as-a-Service, and facilitating. Together with awareness of Conway's law,
team cognitive load, and how to become a sensing organization, Team Topologies results
in an effective and humanistic approach to building and running software systems.

#### The Revival of Conway’s Law
What is conway's Law :

“Organizations which design systems .. . are
constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of

these organizations.”



### Chapter 2: Conway's Law and Why It Matters".



### Chapter 3: Team-First Thinking 

From your current team (or a previous team), how many domains do you think you deal with? Which of the three classes do they fit into: simple, complicated, complex. (Page 43.)
Page 48 lists a few a few things that can make up a Team API. Which are the top three most important for a team?
Have you ever worked on a team that had a high team cognitive load? How did you solve it?


Google on their own teams found that who is on the team matters less than
the team dynamics; and that when it comes to measuring performance, teams matter

more than individuals.? We must, therefore, start with the team for effective software
delivery. There are multiple aspects to consider and nurture: team size, team lifespan,
team relationships, and team cognition.

#### Use Small, Long-Lived Teams as the Standard
