### My notes from Joe Rogan podcast with  Naval Wisdom
 These are not my thoughts, rather my collections of
 notes for future reference:

Top 3 things everyone wants or should be wanting. 

* Wealth. 
* Happiness.
* Health.

Lets talk about wealth : 

We will not become rich by renting our time. We rent our time to our employer, and in return get a monthly salary.
The employer, dictates how, what and where should we work. 

We don't earn when we are on vacation and while we sleep.

Sure hard work is important, but one does not simply can become wealthy by working hard, we have to work on the right thing with the right people.  

One can become rich by :
- Owning a piece of business.
- Having an equity as an owner or an investor.
- Becoming a share holder of a brand.

 
Industrial model of organizations are going to change: Boss's, hierarchy and processes (which slows you down)

We can see these days, with the advent of remote work and #digital nomads


More and more people like to own their schedule, own their time and place and time where they are most productive. In short people are favouring *time and location independence*.
 
Everyone can be rich!
 lack of material possessions can make you un-happy but getting rich can not make you happy.

 lot of people struggle whole life to make money nad
then they make some and when they are exhausted and think wait why i am not happy...if you are smart you should be happy


How someone can solve their money problem : 

1) Lowering your lifestyle.
2) Making enough money. 
3) Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for some 
imaginary tomorrow.

1) Lot of money saved up and the passive income from that..
covers your burn rate, keep your burn rate low.
 
 2) Drive your burn rate to zero ...become a monk (Don't do that if you are reading this)
 
 3) Do something you love, you love so much it's not about money anymore for you. 

 1) Have specific knowledge and skill set so, you don't have completion...because you are authentic, 
 find the thing you know to do better than anybody because you love to do  ...
 
 * authentic
 * map that what society wants
 * leverage,
 * Put your name on it, take the risk but you gain the rewards.

 Ignore the peer, upgrading lifestyle, buying unwanted things, 
 
 Changing the definition of peers.
 Do a remote job, live on low cost country neighborhood hood
 save money.

## Happiness:
